Create a Streamlit page at /app/pages/gc_troubleshooter.py:
- Add a text input for the user to describe a GC problem
- Send that text to a mock AI responder (placeholder function)
- Display the AI's "response" in a chat-style container
- Log the prompt + response below for session review
- Eventually plug into a real LLM or local API
