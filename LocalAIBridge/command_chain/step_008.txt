Create a Streamlit page at /app/pages/gc_csv_analyzer.py:
- Allow user to upload a CSV file with peak data
- Display the data as a table
- Create a plot of Retention Time vs Area (or Height)
- Flag any rows with:
    - Retention Time < 0.5
    - Area < 500
    - Width/RT > 0.25 (tailing flag)
- Allow user to filter flagged peaks only
- Show number of flagged vs total peaks
